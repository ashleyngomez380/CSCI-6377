Cluster_16
The name "cluster_16" signifies that this implementation is the 16-th iteration of your neural network model.

Introduction
Cluster_16 utilizes PyTorch to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. 
The model comprises two convolutional layers followed by a max-pooling layer.
Additionally, this code offers a visualization of the data by displaying the 
first 16 car entries, providing an initial check for data import accuracy.

Usage
To use this code:

Ensure you have a compatible GPU available due to the computational demands.
Input your data in CSV format, containing ID and Pixel information.
Execute the provided script to train the CNN model.
Once trained, the model will predict whether the input image represents a car or a pickup truck.

Dependencies
PyTorch

Note
Given the computational intensity of this model, it's advisable to run it on a system with sufficient GPU resources for optimal performance.
